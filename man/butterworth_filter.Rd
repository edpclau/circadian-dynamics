\usage{
butterworth_filter(df = NULL, order = 2,
f_low= 1/4, f_high = 1/72, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{required. A data.frame object where column 1 is a POSIXct object and the other columns are measurement values.}

\item{order}{filter order. Default = 2.}

\item{f_low}{Frequency for the low pass filter. Default = 1/4.}

\item{f_high}{Frequency for the high pass filter. Default = 1/72.}

\item{plot}{logical. If TRUE (default) plots the filtered data over the raw data. Red line is the low pass filter. Blue is the high pass filter. If FALSE, does not plot.}
}
\description{
A helper function which wraps around the [signal::butter()] and [signal::filfilt()] functions.
It can be either a low or high pass filter for a given period. (The function can take the period argument
because it does the conversion to frequency automatically. (frequency = 1/period).
}
\examples{

butter <- butterworth_filter(df = data, f_low = 1/4, f_high = 1/72)
print(butter)
